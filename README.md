# Files-Exceptional-Handling-Assignment

1. Discuss the scenarios where multithreading is preferable to multiprocessing and scenarios where multiprocessing is a better choice.

2. Describe what a process pool is and how it helps in managing multiple processes efficiently.

3. Explain what multiprocessing is and why it is used in Python programs.

4. Write a Python program using multithreading where one thread adds numbers to a list, and another thread removes numbers from the list. Implement a mechanism to avoid race conditions using threading.Lock.

5. Describe the methods and tools available in Python for safely sharing data between threads and processes.

6. Discuss why itâ€™s crucial to handle exceptions in concurrent programs and the techniques available for doing so.

7. Create a program that uses a thread pool to calculate the factorial of numbers from 1 to 10 concurrently. Use concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor to manage the threads.

8. Create a Python program that uses multiprocessing.Pool to compute the square of numbers from 1 to 10 in parallel. Measure the time taken to perform this computation using a pool of different sizes (e.g., 2, 4, 8 processes).
